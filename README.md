This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the packages with npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then [open http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Open Sans, a custom Google Font.
