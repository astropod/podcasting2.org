      <h1 className="text-4xl">Podcasting 2.0 is for podcasters!</h1>
      <p>
        We believe podcasts deserve an open, independent podcasting ecosystem.
        We created Podcasting 2.0 to preserve, protect, and <em>extend</em> that
        ecosystem.
      </p>
      <h2>Upgrade to the Podcast Namespace</h2>
      <p>
        Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is the foundation for open podcasting.
        But podcast feeds have lacked innovation for years, due in large part to
        leaving it in the hands of large corporatations to innovate&mdash;and
        regularly being disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Podcasting 2.0 changes that by finally bringing fresh innovation to
        podcasting&rsquo;s core technology of RSS. We do this through the
        Podcast Namespace: a new standard for RSS feeds that bring multiple
        benefits for audiences, podcasters, and developers.
      </p>
